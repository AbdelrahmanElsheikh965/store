We can develop progressive web applications (PWA) using Angular

Both AngularJS and Angular significantly reduce development time. However, due to the component-based architecture and more effective data binding, 
Angular apps can be five times faster than AngularJS.

### Angular 17 Latest Features: What to Expect!
1. Quick Recursive Type Checking – If you use code or libraries with recursive types, TypeScript 5.2 can provide a significant performance boost of 33%, according to tests.

2. New Declarative Control Flow Syntax – The new control flow syntax in Angular 17

3. Lazy Loaded Images Slow Down Page Render Error 
When developing web applications, you can use NgOptimizedImages to manage images. This tool can detect which images are essential for the initial app loading. If you don’t specify these images as a top priority, they will load slowly, resulting in a longer loading time for the first app launch.

4. Setup Routes for Unique Testing

5. CSS Automatic Removal
